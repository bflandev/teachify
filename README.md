# Learn Wren: Open-Source Educational Video Platform

Learn Wren is a self-hosted, open-source educational platform as a platform for creators. It enables any registered user to create and publish video-based courses organised into modules and lessons. Courses are consumed by enrolled students who can stream protected video content and download supplementary lesson materials. The platform is designed for small communities — such as a group of friends, a company, or a non-profit — and can be deployed on commodity hardware or a cloud server. All video content is protected by industry-standard Digital Rights Management (DRM) to prevent unauthorised redistribution.
