# Learn Wren: Open-Source Educational Video Platform

Learn Wren is a self-hosted, open-source educational platform as a platform for creators. It enables any registered user to create and publish video-based courses organised into modules and lessons. Courses are consumed by enrolled students who can stream protected video content and download supplementary lesson materials. The platform is designed for small communities — such as a group of friends, a company, or a non-profit — and can be deployed on commodity hardware or a cloud server. All video content is protected by industry-standard Digital Rights Management (DRM) to prevent unauthorised redistribution.

> [!NOTE]
> **PROJECT STATUS: EARLY DEVELOPMENT**
> The monorepo and a minimal "hello world" slice for both apps are in place. Firebase, Firestore, authentication, and the video/DRM pipeline are not yet wired up — those are tracked in upcoming design specs under `docs/superpowers/specs/`.

## Monorepo Layout

This is an [Nx](https://nx.dev) workspace using pnpm. It contains an Angular SPA, a NestJS API, their Playwright E2E suites, and a shared TypeScript library.

| Project | Type | Stack |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `web` | Application | Angular 21, Tailwind, SCSS |
| `api` | Application | NestJS 11, Webpack |
| `shared-data-models` | Library | TypeScript types (consumed by `web` and `api`) |
| `web-e2e`, `api-e2e` | E2E suite | Playwright |

The planned production deployment targets are Firebase Hosting (web) and Firebase Cloud Functions (api), backed by Firestore, Cloud Storage, and Firebase Authentication. See [`docs/epics/TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md`](./docs/epics/TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22** (LTS) — pinned in `.nvmrc`. Install with `nvm install 22 && nvm use 22` or Volta.
- **pnpm** — activate via Corepack: `corepack enable && corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate`.

### Install

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Run

Run both apps in parallel (Angular on `:4200`, NestJS on `:3333`):

```bash
pnpm start
```

Or run them individually:

```bash
pnpm start:web   # Angular SPA on http://localhost:4200
pnpm start:api   # NestJS API on http://localhost:3333/api
```

Verify the API is up:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3333/api/health
```

### Scripts

All scripts run from the repo root and delegate to Nx.

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `pnpm start` | Serve `web` and `api` in parallel. |
| `pnpm start:web` | Serve the Angular SPA only. |
| `pnpm start:api` | Serve the NestJS API only. |
| `pnpm build` | Build all buildable projects to `dist/`. |
| `pnpm test` | Run all Vitest unit tests. |
| `pnpm lint` | Run ESLint across all projects. |
| `pnpm typecheck` | Type-check all projects. |
| `pnpm e2e` | Run the Playwright E2E suites (sequential). |
| `pnpm affected` | Run lint + test + build + typecheck only for projects affected by the current branch. |

To target a single project, invoke Nx directly — e.g. `pnpm nx test web`, `pnpm nx build api`, `pnpm nx lint shared-data-models`.

## Product Specifications

The product requirements are defined using the original Agile methodology, broken down into Epics and User Stories with detailed Acceptance Criteria. EP-01 through EP-06 form the MVP scope; EP-07 through EP-09 are post-MVP.

| `05` | [Course Discovery and Enrollment](./docs/epics/05-course-discovery-and-enrollment.md) | Browsing, searching, and enrolling in courses. |
| `06` | [Learning Experience](./docs/epics/06-learning-experience.md) | Consuming course content, tracking progress, and resuming sessions. |
| `07` | [Instructor Dashboard](./docs/epics/07-instructor-dashboard.md) | Managing courses, viewing enrolled students, and monitoring engagement. |
| `08` | [Platform Administration](./docs/epics/08-platform-administration.md) | User management, content moderation, and system configuration. |
| `09` | [Non-Functional Requirements](./docs/epics/09-non-functional-requirements.md) | Performance, security, accessibility, and open-source compliance. |
