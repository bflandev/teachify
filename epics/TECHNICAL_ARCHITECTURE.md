# Technical Architecture: Teachify

This document outlines the recommended technical architecture for the Teachify platform. The architecture is designed to be modular, scalable, and self-hostable, using open-source technologies wherever possible.

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Component | Recommended Technology | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | Web Application | React or Vue.js | Mature ecosystems, component-based architecture, strong community support. |
| **Backend** | API Server | Node.js (Express/Fastify) or Python (Django/FastAPI) | Both are well-suited for building RESTful or GraphQL APIs with strong LMS ecosystem support. |
| **Database** | Relational Data | PostgreSQL | Robust, open-source RDBMS with excellent support for complex queries and JSONB for flexible data. |
| **Cache** | Session and Metadata | Redis | In-memory data store for session tokens, rate limiting, and caching course metadata. |
| **Object Storage** | Video and File Storage | MinIO | Self-hosted, S3-compatible object storage ideal for large video files. |
| **Video Transcoding** | Pipeline | FFmpeg + Worker Queue (BullMQ/Celery) | FFmpeg is the industry-standard open-source transcoding tool; a message queue manages asynchronous jobs. |
| **Video Packaging** | HLS/DASH Packaging | Shaka Packager | Open-source tool from Google for packaging video into HLS and DASH with CENC encryption. |
| **DRM** | License Server | Widevine (Google), PlayReady (Microsoft), FairPlay (Apple) via EZDRM or a self-hosted solution | Multi-DRM ensures compatibility across all major browsers and devices. |
| **Video Player** | Web Player | Shaka Player or Video.js with DRM plugins | Both are open-source, support HLS/DASH, and integrate with Widevine, PlayReady, and FairPlay. |
| **Authentication** | Identity Provider | Keycloak (self-hosted) or custom JWT implementation | Keycloak provides enterprise-grade SSO, OAuth2, and OIDC support out of the box. |
| **Deployment** | Containerisation | Docker + Docker Compose | Simplifies self-hosted deployment and ensures environment consistency. |
| **CDN / Reverse Proxy** | Content Delivery | Nginx + optional CDN (e.g., Bunny.net) | Nginx serves as a reverse proxy and can deliver HLS segments; a CDN reduces latency for geographically distributed users. |
