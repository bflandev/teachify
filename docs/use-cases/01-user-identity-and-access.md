## UC-01-01 — Register a New Account

```
Use Case: UC-01-01 — Register a New Account

Goal in Context:  A guest creates a platform account to access learning content.
Scope:            Learn Wren Platform
Level:            Primary Task
Primary Actor:    Guest
Preconditions:    - The guest has navigated to the registration page.
                  - The guest does not already have an account.
Success End:      A new inactive account exists with the Student role.
                  A verification email has been sent to the provided address.
Failed End:       No account is created. The guest remains unauthenticated.

Main Success Scenario:
  1. The guest navigates to the registration page.
  2. The system displays a registration form requesting a display name, email
     address, and password.
  3. The guest enters a display name, a unique email address, and a password
     that meets the complexity requirements.
  4. The system validates the input:
     - Email is a valid format and not already registered.
     - Password is at least 12 characters and contains at least one uppercase
       letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character.
  5. The system creates an inactive account with the Student role.
  6. The system sends a verification email containing a unique activation link.
  7. The system displays a confirmation message instructing the guest to check
     their email.
  8. The guest clicks the activation link in the email.
  9. The system activates the account and redirects to the login page.

Extensions:
  3a. The email address is already registered:
      1. The system displays a generic error message (e.g., "Unable to complete
         registration. Please check your details.") without revealing whether
         the email is in use (to prevent enumeration attacks).
      2. The use case ends.

  3b. The password does not meet complexity requirements:
      1. The system displays a specific error indicating which requirements
         are not met (e.g., "Password must contain at least one digit").
      2. The guest corrects the password and resubmits.
      3. The use case continues from step 4.

  8a. The activation link has expired:
      1. The system displays an error indicating the link has expired.
      2. The system offers a "Resend Verification Email" option.
      3. The guest requests a new email and the use case continues from step 6.

  8b. The activation link is invalid or has already been used:
      1. The system displays an error: "This link is invalid or has already
         been used."
      2. The use case ends.
